## Boris Bikes 

##### Brief:

**Transport for London**, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, comes to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
